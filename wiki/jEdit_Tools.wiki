AIRcable jEdit's Tools
= Introduction =

We have been working on a series of tools for jEdit. Here you will find information about them.


= Installation =
The installation process is quite easy, first of all if you don't have jEdit installed please install it get into www.jedit.org and follow the steps from there.

Once you have jEdit installed, get into our [http://code.google.com/p/aircable/downloads/list Download Section] and download the last version of the *jEdit Tools*, when we wrote this text that version was 01 Alpha.

The files that are stored in that archive must be uncompressed inside the user settings, you can get this folder from the jEdit's Menu (_Utilities->Settings Directory_ the first line says the folder path)

You should also add this line to the $HOME\.jedit\modes\catalog:
{{{
<MODE NAME="AIRcable" FILE="AIRcable.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="AIRcable.bas" />
}}}
This line must be before the _</MODES>_

Once that is done, restart jEdit and you will have all the tool set available (this also includes the highlighting stuff). You will have the tools under _Macros->AIRcable_. You can make key shortcuts to this tools, or add this tools to the contextual menu, check the jEdit docs for this (or mail us for support)
