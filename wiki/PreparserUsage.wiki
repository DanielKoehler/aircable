Templates are everywhere around, and python programming language is no exception. By using [http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/ Cheetah Template Engine] we have been able to create some little functions that allow to easily create code that can talk to any stream: Slave, Master and UART.

= Installation =

Before been able to use this template you will need a few prerequisites. You will need to get [http://www.python.org/ Python] 2.6 and [http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/ Cheetah] 2.x installed. If you're running any Unix based OS like MacOS or Linux then it's quite sure you all ready have python installed, Cheetah can be easily installed by using the package manager from your OS.
