WWXXYYZZMESSAGE
WW Hexadecimal level, 0 for root, always valid
XX Hexadecimal next level, valid only if action <> !
YY Hexadecimal previous level, valid if level > 0
ZZ action, !! for none action, MESSAGE takes an special
	meaning in this case
	
for backward compatibility all lines have fixed length = 31 chars
If you need to extend to 32 chars you just don't add a line feed after each one
Line feeds are just \n as any UNIX system, \n\r from windows is not ok.
	
Each level can have up to 20 childs or system becames
too slow, still we don't recommend so many levels, it will
not be friendly for the user

A BACK menu option is not provided by the core code
but rather by the menu code to give way more flexibility

WARNING: There's no runtime check on the BASIC code, user code has
to do the check

Actions:
	t read temperature, show on screen
	l read temperature check colder than MESSAGE (in C)
	h read temperature check hotter than MESSAGE (in C)
	r read temperature check in range, message=XXXX YYYY
		XXXX lower value, YYYY higher one
	m read temperature send message to pair
	
	More actions can be added if you need them
